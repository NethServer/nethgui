Apply changes (Save)
--------------------

The User wants to modify a form and save the changes.

1. The *Save* button is disabled

2. User changes some values on the form displayed.

3. The *Save* button becomes enabled.

4. User clicks on the *Save* button at the bottom of the form.

5. A *feedback message* appears on the top of the page to confirm
   everything is fine (or that some error has occurred).

   a) If everything is fine, *Save* button becomes disabled.
   b) Else the error message explains the problem and *Save* keeps enabled state.

After the last step::

   +----------------------------------------+
   |                                       X|
   | Congratulations! - feedback message    |
   |                                        |
   +----------------------------------------+

   ( ) Unselected  
   (o) Selected
      .----------------------------------.
      |                                  |
      |       Insert text [Hello_____]   |
      | Another insertion [World!____]   |
      |                                  |
      |  [x] Option 1                    |
      |  [x] Option 2                    |
      |  [ ] Option 3                    |
      +----------------------------------+

                                     | Save |




Notifications
-------------

The User has performed some kind of *system change
operation*. Depending on the operation outcome, there can be three
types of messages:

1. **Success** message, if the change was successful and
   accomplished the wished effect.

2. **Warning** message, if the change was successful, but brought the
   system in an unexpected state that must be embossed.

3. **Error** message, if the change was unsuccessful.

Messages can be displayed in two ways: (1) embedded frame, (2) modal dialog.

The **embedded frame** is displayed on the top of the screen. The User can
close it by clicking on the "X" button, or ignore it::

   +----------------------------------------+
   |                                     [X]|
   | Warning: the specified ntp host is     |
   |          unreachable!                  |
   |                                        |
   +----------------------------------------+

The **modal dialog box** is ovelayed on the screen and represents a
mandatory decision point. 

- Each decision closes the dialog and possibly causes a further action
  to occur.

- The last button has the same effect of a click on the dialog
  dismission button ``[X]``.

::

   +----------------------------------------+
   | Warning                             [X]|
   |                                        |
   | The specified ntp host is unreachable! |
   |                                        |
   |             [ Disable NTP ] [ Ignore ] |
   +----------------------------------------+


Validation errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Validation errors are a special case of Notifications_.  

1. The User submitted some invalid input data. 

2. An embedded frame message appears, reporting the problems as a
   list. For each invalid input field:

  1. The label is displayed. A click on the label give focus to the
     input field.
  2. A text explaining why the problem occurred follows.

3. The invalid input fields are embossed in a different color/style.

For instance::

   +-------------------------------------------------+
   |                                              [X]|
   |    Email: invalid email address                 |
   | Username: only lowercase letters are allowed    |
   |                                                 |
   +-------------------------------------------------+
  
     First Name:  [John______________]

      Last Name:  [Doe_______________]   

          Email: *[johndo@com________]*

       Username: *[JohnDoe___________]*

---------------

1. A set of exclusive choices represented by radio buttons or a checkbox is displayed.

2. The User chooses, by clicking on the control or its textual label.

Table CRUD
----------

Sample table::

   +--------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | User name  v | First Name     | Last Name     | Actions               |
   +--------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | johns        | John           | Smith         | [ Modify ] [ Delete ] |
   +--------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | scott        | Scott          | Tiger         | [ Modify ] [ Delete ] |
   +--------------+----------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   
                                                         [ Create new User ]


Read
^^^^

Data is displayed in tabular form. Each row of the table ends with two
buttons:

1. Modify

2. Delete

The first row of the table contains the column headers. A click on the
header *may* change the order of the rows - this depends on the table
desired behaviour.


Create
^^^^^^

The User wants to create a new table element.

1. The User clicks on the *Create new...* button.

2. A form appears with necessary fields [#form-appears]_.

3. The User compiles the form and confirms (i.e. clicks a *Create*
   button).

4. If input is validated, a successful feedback is displayed on the
   top of the screen.

5. The original table is refreshed. Depending on sorting and
   pagination, the created row can be immediatly visible or not.  

   a) If the record is visible its temporarly highlighted.
   b) If the record is not visibile, the feedback message offers a
      shortcut to its position.




Update
^^^^^^

The User wants to change an existing table element.

1. The User clicks on the *Modify* button of the element row.

2. Create_ scenario applies, only form fields are pre-compiled with
   actual record values.


Delete
^^^^^^

The User wants to delete a table element

1. The User clicks on the *Delete* button of the element row.

2. A modal dialog asks for confirmation.

3. The User confirm deletion.

4. Successful feedback is displayed.

5. The deleted row folds up.

6. The original table is refreshed, coherently with its current
   sorting and pagination state.


.. [#form-appears] (1) A modal dialog box containing form fields
         appears, overlaying the screen or (2) The table is hidden and
         the form fields appear in its place.



Wizard
------

A wizard guides the User through a stepped procedure. Every step is a
form. For each step:

1. The User fills the form.

2. The Users clicks on the *Next* button .

3. The form is validated.

   a) In case of validation error the standard validation error
   procedure and visual feedback applies. See `Validation errors`_.

4. The next step form is displayed

On the last step the *Save* button is displayed instead of *Next*. 


Notes:

* At every step except the first a *Previous* button allows the User
  to switch back to previous step.
* Field values are remembered while the User moves forward and backward.
* Moreover the next step may be dependent on values inserted on the
  previous one *(branches)*.


Wizard at intermediate step:: 

    1.  Account type
    2. *Personal informations*
    3.  Password settings
    4.  Confirmation

    First Name [___________________]
     Last Name [___________________]
       Country [___________|v]

                            [ Previous ] [   Next   ]

A brief summary of all the wizard steps is displayed on the top of
each form, emphasizing the current step.



Tabs
----

The User faces a complex configuration.  Tabs allows grouping of
strictly related form controls into distinct (and loosely related)
tab-pages::
   
    .-----------. .-----------.
    |   Tab 1   | |   Tab 2   |
   -+           +-+-----------+-----------...  
   
   // form controls omitted
   
                                    [ Save ]
   ------------------------------------------
    

1. "Tab 1" (see figure) is currently selected.

2. The User changes some values in "Tab 1" form.

3. The User switches to "Tab 2" by clicking on its label.

4. The User changes some values in "Tab 2" form.

5. The User click on "Save" button of "Tab 2" form.

   a) Validation occurs on "Tab 2" only.
   b) Only "Tab 2" form controls are saved.

8. The User switches back to "Tab 1" again: previously changed values
   in "Tab 1" are **still unsaved**.

Thus each page keeps an indipendent validation and saving state.
